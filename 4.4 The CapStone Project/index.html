    <h2> Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>
        Software Development Intern – Samsung R & D Institute, Bangalore (Jan 2023 - July 2023)
    </h3>
    <h3>Motion Tracking of Object - Computer Vision, AR/VR:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked on the realistic AR/VR to avoid virtual object drifting in 3-D scenes using SLAM.</li>
        <li>Replaced and integrated AR - Core with another AR core SDK like Vuforia, Easy AR and Benchmarked their accuracy. I tested in challenging scenarios like low light, texture less, fast-moving scenes.</li>
        <li>Developed vision solutions to handle drift problem during tracking state, tracked sparse point cloud for each frame
            and calculated drift of each point, and developed ICP algorithm using open3D to reduce this shift.</li>
        <li>Achieved less than 5 cm drift.</li>
    </ul>
